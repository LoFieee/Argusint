# Argusint
A tool that uses existing osint tools and apis to optimise the osint workflow

In Greek mythology, Argus Panoptes was a giant with hundreds of eyes, known for being an excellent guardian and always vigilant. This tool is inspired by Argus's omnipresent surveillance and the ability to collect information across many fields simultaneously.
